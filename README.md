# alx-graphql-0x03

This project is part of the ALX Frontend curriculum. It demonstrates how to build a simple React application that fetches data using **GraphQL** with the **Apollo Client**.

## 📘 Description

The app connects to the Rick and Morty GraphQL API to display information about episodes and characters. It also includes an `ErrorBoundary` component to gracefully catch and handle runtime errors in the UI.
